# Exploring in silico pharmacological actions of pyramax against Sars-cov-2



## Main contents
- Pyronaridine & Artesunate pharmacological actions against SARS-CoV-2

## Introduction
This study describes the basic steps and methodologies used in ‘in silico’ drug discovery. Based on the in vitro evidence that Pyramax inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, this study systematically investigates the pharmacological potential of Pyramax using an ‘in silico’ approach.
